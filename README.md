Intel purchased Nervana Systems who was developing both a GPU/software approach in addition to their Nervana Engine ASIC. Comparable performance is unclear. Intel is also planning in integrating into the Phi platform via a [Knights Crest](https://www.nextplatform.com/2016/11/22/inside-intels-strategy-integrate-nervana-deep-learning-assets/) project. [NextPlatform](https://www.nextplatform.com/2016/08/08/deep-learning-chip-upstart-set-take-gpus-task/) suggested the 2017 target on 28nm may be 55 TOPS/s for some width of OP.

[Building Bigger, Faster GPU Clusters Using NVSwitches](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/04/13/building-bigger-faster-gpu-clusters-using-nvswitches/)
> Nvidia launched its second-generation DGX system in March. In order to build the 2 petaflops half-precision DGX-2, Nvidia had to first design and build a new NVLink 2.0 switch chip, named NVSwitch. While Nvidia is only shipping NVSwitch as an integral component of its DGX-2 systems today, Nvidia has not precluded selling NVSwitch chips to data center equipment manufacturers.

[Nvidia's latest GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-v100/) can do 15 TFlops of SP or 120 TFlops with its new Tensor core architecture which is a FP16 multiply and FP32 accumulate or add to suit ML.<br><br>

Now the open source DLA is available on [Github](https://github.com/nvdla/) and more information can be found [here](http://nvdla.org/).
> The NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) is a free and open architecture that promotes a standard way to design deep learning inference accelerators. With its modular architecture, NVDLA is scalable, highly configurable, and designed to simplify integration and portability. The hardware supports a wide range of IoT devices. Delivered as an open source project under the NVIDIA Open NVDLA License, all of the software, hardware, and documentation will be available on GitHub. Contributions are welcome.

If your calculations are amenable to Nvidia's Tensors, then AMD can't compete. Nvidia also does twice the bandwidth with 900GB/s versus AMD's 484 GB/s.

> AMD has put [a very good X86 server processor](https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/08/08/shape-amd-hpc-ai-iron-come/) into the market for the first time in nine years, and it also has a matching GPU that gives its OEM and ODM partners a credible alternative for HPC and AI workload to the combination of Intel Xeons and Nvidia Teslas that dominate hybrid computing these days.

[TrueNorth](http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brain-chip.shtml) is IBM's Neuromorphic CMOS ASIC developed in conjunction with the DARPA [SyNAPSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyNAPSE) program.
> It is a manycore processor network on a chip design, with 4096 cores, each one simulating 256 programmable silicon "neurons" for a total of just over a million neurons. In turn, each neuron has 256 programmable "synapses" that convey the signals between them. Hence, the total number of programmable synapses is just over 268 million (228). In terms of basic building blocks, its transistor count is 5.4 billion. Since memory, computation, and communication are handled in each of the 4096 neurosynaptic cores, TrueNorth circumvents the von-Neumann-architecture bottlenecks and is very energy-efficient, consuming 70 milliwatts, about 1/10,000th the power density of conventional microprocessors.

Google's [original TPU](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/05/an-in-depth-look-at-googles-first-tensor-processing-unit-tpu) had a big lead over GPUs and helped power DeepMind's AlphaGo victory over Lee Sedol in a Go tournament. The original 700MHz TPU is described as having 95 TFlops for 8-bit calculations or 23 TFlops for 16-bit whilst drawing only 40W. This was much faster than GPUs on release but is now slower than Nvidia's V100, but not on a per W basis. The new [TPU2](https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/05/22/hood-googles-tpu2-machine-learning-clusters/) is referred to as a TPU device with four chips and can do around 180 TFlops. Each chip's performance has been doubled to 45 TFlops for 16-bits. You can see the gap to Nvidia's V100 is closing. You can't buy a TPU or TPU2. <br><br>
[Lately](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/02/Cloud-TPU-machine-learning-accelerators-now-available-in-beta.html), Google is making [Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/) available for use in [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/). Here you can find the latest [banchmark result of Google TPU2](https://blog.riseml.com/benchmarking-googles-new-tpuv2-121c03b71384).<br><br>
[Pixel Visual Core](https://www.blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-visual-core-image-processing-and-machine-learning-pixel-2/) is Google’s first custom-designed co-processor for consumer products. It’s built into every Pixel 2, and in the coming months, we’ll turn it on through a software update to enable more applications to use Pixel 2’s camera for taking HDR+ quality pictures.

**[Tearing Apart Google’s TPU 3.0 AI Coprocessor](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/05/10/tearing-apart-googles-tpu-3-0-ai-coprocessor/)**
> Google did its best to impress this week at its annual IO conference. While Google rolled out a bunch of benchmarks that were run on its current Cloud TPU instances, based on TPUv2 chips, the company divulged a few skimpy details about its next generation TPU chip and its systems architecture. The company changed from version notation (TPUv2) to revision notation (TPU 3.0) with the update, but ironically the detail we have assembled shows that the step from TPUv2 to what we will call TPUv3 probably isn’t that big; it should probably be called TPU v2r5 or something like that.

**[Edge TPU](https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu/)**
> AI is pervasive today, from consumer to enterprise applications. With the explosive growth of connected devices, combined with a demand for privacy/confidentiality, low latency and bandwidth constraints, AI models trained in the cloud increasingly need to be run at the edge. Edge TPU is Google’s purpose-built ASIC designed to run AI at the edge. It delivers high performance in a small physical and power footprint, enabling the deployment of high-accuracy AI at the edge.

In the [June 2017 Green500 list](https://www.top500.org/green500/list/2017/06/), a Nvidia P100 system took the number one spot and there is a Pezy-SC2 system at number 7.

Operating at 1 GHz with 4 FLOPS per cycle per core as with the SC, the SC2 has a peak performance of 8.192 TFLOPS (single-precision). Both prior chips were manufactured on TSMC’s 28HPC+, however in order to enable the considerably higher core count within reasonable power consumption, PEZY decided to skip a generation and go directly to TSMC’s 16FF+ Technology.
